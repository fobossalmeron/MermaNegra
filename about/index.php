         <h2> About: </h2>
        <p>
        Mermanegra is an emerging proposal born as a new approach to the Mexican design scene where the line that divides gender is diluted.<br><br>
This project is influenced by the streets, the people, the noise, the parties, and the day to day experiences in a great city. The hustle and lifestyle of living in Mexico City is what constitutes the identity to these designers' clothes.<br><br>
Every garment is thought out to be gender-neutral, breaking the boundaries of usability and gender-defined culture. This is achieved through a method that our designers like to call: <em>experimental couture</em>, which blends everyday comfortable fabrics and high fashion patterns, cuts, and drops.
